The basic concept of [hooking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hooking) is common across all of computer science. To put it simply, it's a method of changing the behavior of an existing program by intercepting calls to functions.

In Battle Brothers we are fortunate to have effectively unlimited access to modifying the [[Battle Brothers Class|BB Classes]] created by the game thanks to [[Introduction|Modern Hooks]], conceptually based on [Adam Milazzo's](http://adammil.net/) original [modding script hooks](https://www.nexusmods.com/battlebrothers/mods/42). This means that any game logic handled by squirrel code can be changed without requiring any [[Replacing Files|replacement of files]]. Additionally, by loading JS files, we are also able to modify JS objects in the same way.
