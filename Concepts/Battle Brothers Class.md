Battle Brothers uses a unique implementation of Object Oriented Programing, separate from the standard [squirrel class](https://developer.electricimp.com/squirrel/squirrel-guide/classes). Effectively, each 'class' is a [table](https://developer.electricimp.com/squirrel/table) (Similar to [JavaScript Objects](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object)), and each 'instance' is also a table which has been [cloned](https://developer.electricimp.com/squirrel/keywords#clone) from the original 'class'. Tables that inherit from parents have their parents set using Squirrel's [setdelegate](https://developer.electricimp.com/squirrel/table/setdelegate) function upon instantiation.

When a table is still a 'class' we refer to it as a prototype object, in this state it doesn't have it's delegation set up, and therefore calling [getdelegate](https://developer.electricimp.com/squirrel/table/getdelegate) on it will return null. However, it does contain a clone of its parent as a value in the class table with the key being the name of the parent.

For example, `scripts/items/weapons/weapon` inherits from `scripts/items/item`, so you can access a clone of the item 'bb class' inside a weapon using `<class>.item`. To instead dynamically resolve the parent of the current item we can use `<class>.SuperName` which would in this case be `"item"` and therefore access our parent using `<class>[<class>.SuperName]`. This can return unexpected results when used inside of the function body of a function in a BB Class, as this function can be called by a descendant of the class it was already placed in and in that case `<class>[<class>.SuperName]` could actually be referencing the very table the function is in, which could lead to infinite recursion.

Despite being incredibly inefficient (~40x more memory usage and ~50x slower to instantiate than native squirrel classes), BB objects have one advantage over more traditional squirrel classes: it is possible to modify the functions of an already instantiated BB object. This can be used for a so called [[Switcheroo Hook]]
