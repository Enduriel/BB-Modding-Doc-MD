MSU or Modding Standards & Utilities is a modding library created by LordMidas, TaroEld and myself, with the purpose of simplifying many modding functions that would be very difficult without it.
Read the [Wiki](https://github.com/MSUTeam/MSU/wiki) for more information. If you're a modder who wants to do anything more than the absolute basics, you should take a look at its features.
